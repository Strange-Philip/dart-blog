### Setup

To setup and run this project, Install [`Melos`](https://melos.invertase.dev/~melos-latest) as a global package via [`pub.dev`](https://pub.dev/packages/melos);

```shell
$ dart pub global activate melos
```

then initialize the workspace using the command below

```shell
$ melos bootstrap
```

### Bootstrap

This project consists of a Backend using Yaroo & Flutter Web for the frontend. You'll need to run this command so Flutter web can be bundled into the `public` folder.

```shell
$ melos build:backend
```

#### Backend Workflow

We rely heavily on code-generation. Things like adding a new `Middleware`, `Controller`, `Controller Method` require you to re-run the command below.

```shell
$ dart pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Database Migration

This project comes with a CLI for running migrations on your database. There are only 3 main commands for now. `migrate`, `migrate:reset` and `migrate:rollback`.

```shell
$ dart run bin/tools/migrator.dart <command-goes-here>
```

The project uses `sqlite` by default. You can configure it to use `MariaDB` or `MySQL`.

### Start Server

```shell
$ dart run
```

### Tests

```shell
$ dart test
```
